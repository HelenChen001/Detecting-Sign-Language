# KNN for ASL image classification

## Algorithm 

1. Preprocess data
   - Ensure images are same size
   - Turn images into greyscale
   - Turn images into a flattened array
   - Import dataset into numpy array
   - Split datset into training and testing set
     - For the training set images, attach a label in the first index to indicate what letter
2. Feature extraction
3. Distance metric
4. KNN voting
5. Predict test dataset
6. Confusion matrix
